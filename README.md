# Experiments-with-web-dev-HTML-CSS-

In this repository I have uploaded simple animation and pure image drawings using HTML and CSS only without any external file or images.


I am experimenting and creating pure HTML CSS mini projects for creating animation and images using features of HTML CSS only.

I will be uploading new folders as I complete them are as follows:

  1) Bounsing Square:- In this project I am creating an animation of a square object jumping on a trampoline in infinite loop. It has following structure:-
        - The ".container" class defines a full-screen container that is centered vertically and horizontally on the web page. The ".wrapper" class defines a rectangle             with a light blue background, rounded corners and a shadow effect, which serves as the parent container for all other elements on the page. The ".rubber" class           defines a rectangle at the bottom of the ".wrapper" class with a coral border, shadow and an animation effect to make it look like a rubber sheet.
        
        - The ".stick" class defines two rectangles, one on the left and one on the right, that serve as supports for the rubber sheet. The ".left-stick" class and                 ".right-stick" class add the specific styles for each stick, including the left and right positions, background color, and shadow effects.
        
        - The ".square" class defines a white square with a shadow effect and an animation effect to make it look like it is jumping.
        
        - The "@keyframes" animations defined in the CSS code specify the motion and transformations of the rubber sheet and square elements.
        - For source code visit "Bouncing_square" file.
